# Introduction
[Haskell]("https://www.haskell.org/") is an advanced, purely functional programming language. In particularly, it is a [polymorphically statically typed, lazy, purely functional language,]("https://www.haskell.org/definition/") quite different from most other programming languages. The language is named for Haskell Brooks Curry, whose work in mathematical logic serves as a foundation for functional languages. Haskell is based on the lambda calculus, hence the lambda we use as a logo.
