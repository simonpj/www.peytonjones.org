<!-- A refined page is a standard page for the website. In particular, a refined page is used for pages that include images, videos, or other media than simply text and links. --> 

<!-- 1: To create a new refined page, create a new markdown file within the _pages folder. Make sure to include ".md" in the title to ensure the file is using the markdown format. -->

  <!-- In the markdown file, copy and paste the following metadata: -->

  ---
  title: "PAGE TITLE"
  header:
    overlay_image: /assets/images/spj-stock-header.jpg 
    overlay_filter: 0.5
  permalink: /PERMALINK-HERE/
  ---
  
   <!-- You can also copy this template and remove all of these comments around the metadata. --> 


<!-- 2: add your page content. -->

  <!-- The content of your page may vary, but you can add text using formatting in markdown,such as 
  Headers:
    # Header level 1
    ## Header level 2
    ### Header level 3
    #### Header level 4
  No octothropes for normal body paragraphs.

  **Bolding fonts** by using either double **astricks** or __double underscores__. You can *italicize fonts* using a single *astrick* or _underscore_. A word or phrase can be made _*bold and italic*_ by combining the above. You can use ***three astricks*** or ___three underscores___, or _*one of each*_. 

  To create block quotes, use a carrot. For example:
  > If this wasn't a comment, it would be in a block quote format.

  <!-- You can embbed videos by using the expression: {% include video id="EPGqzkEZWyw" provider="youtube" %} 
  This expression is used to embed a video from Youtube. The video ID in the above example is 'EPGqzkEZWyw'. This ID can be found on Youtube in a few differnet locations: in the video URL (after "watch?v=") or under "share", which creates a link such as "https://youtu.be/EPGqzkEZWyw".
