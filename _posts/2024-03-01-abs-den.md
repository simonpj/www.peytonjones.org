# Abstract

We explore *denotational interpreters*:
denotational semantics that produce coinductive traces of a corresponding
small-step operational semantics.
By parameterising our denotational interpreter over the semantic domain
and then varying it, we recover *dynamic semantics* with different
evaluation strategies as well as *summary-based static analyses* such as type
analysis, all from the same generic interpreter.
Among our contributions is the first provably adequate denotational semantics
for call-by-need.
The generated traces lend themselves well to describe *operational properties*
such as evaluation cardinality, and hence to static analyses abstracting these
operational properties.
Since static analysis and dynamic semantics share the same generic interpreter
definition, soundness proofs via abstract interpretation decompose into
showing small abstraction laws about the abstract domain, thus obviating
complicated ad-hoc preservation-style proof frameworks.
