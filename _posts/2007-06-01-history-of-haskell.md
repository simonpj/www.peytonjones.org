# Abstract
This long (55-page) paper describes the history of Haskell, including its genesis and principles, technical contributions, implementations and tools, and applications and impact.

You might also be interested in Simon’s POPL’03 talk: [A retrospective on Haskell](../wearing-the-hair-shirt).

# Video

{% include video id="06x8Wf2r2Mc" provider="youtube" %}

The video starts a minute or so into the talk, but nothing important is missing.
