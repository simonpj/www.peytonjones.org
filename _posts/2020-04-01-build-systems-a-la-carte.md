# Abstract
Build systems are awesome, terrifying – and unloved. They are used by every developer around the world, but are rarely the object of study. In this paper we offer a systematic, and executable, framework for developing and comparing build systems, viewing them as related points in a landscape rather than as isolated phenomena. By teasing apart existing build systems, we can recombine their components, allowing us to prototype new build systems with desired properties.

This is a revised and expanded journal version of our [ICFP’18 paper “Build systems a la carte”](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/build-systems-la-carte/), with more detail and a new section on our experience of turning theory into practice.

Executable code is [available here](https://github.com/snowleopard/build/releases/tag/jfp-preprint).
